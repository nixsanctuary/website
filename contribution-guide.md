# Content Writing for NixSanctuary.com - your safe source for tech

Do you have expert knowledge of some aspect of the tech community? Are you interested in looking into the development of software projects of Linux | macOS | iOS | Android | BSD. Do you have an urge to write high-quality articles for extremely picky editors and demanding readers? If so, writing for us may be for you. Please read on for information on how you can participate in the creation of NS.

## What do we seek?

Authors who can contribute articles on a freelance basis. Our needs fall into two areas: "newsy" articles, based on some recent event, discussion, release, new feature, or similar in the software/hardware world and longer for instance the recent OnePlus 10 Pro release, as well as articles that are not so tightly tied to this week's news for instance review or opinion or research posts. We are always looking for contributions to our tech coverage, in particular, but there are literally thousands of other projects with news that our readers would be interested in.

## How to contribute?

If you wish to write one or more articles for us, the first order of business is to contact us (at admin@nixsanctuary.com) to discuss your interests. Please do not just send articles without talking to us first, albeit, rest assured we won't be processing anything without your prior consent. We'll discuss subjects and timelines and come to a determination on whether your content is good enough for us and vice-versa.

Copyrights and further reproduction

Authors retain the copyrights for their work. We ask that you grant NS exclusive rights to publish your work for the period - currently up to two weeks after publication. Thereafter, we retain the right to publish the material, and release it under the Creative Commons Attribution-ShareAlike 4.0 license (CC BY-SA 4.0). After the period, authors may republish their work however they wish.

You may voluntarily choose to be our exclusive author, with added benefits as a college student or part-time writer who is willing to explore in the field of content writing.

## Style guide and Ethos

Our ethos is to promote free software and consumer friendly tech without being too stubborn to our ideas and accepting other information with an open mind.

We are trying to provide next quality standards for our readers:

- high degree respect to readers
- solid tech competence
- high quality writing

We have to be able to edit publications before writing and reserve the right to decline it if and when required. We aim to be a responsible publisher with focus on facts and dataset versus mere speculations. Of course, we expect the same from you without tight encumbrance on your thought process.

## Pricing

Minimum article length is 800+ words with no cap on maximum words, but we expect it to be up to 900 words for a standard post. New authors will get 7.5 USD per article, then 10 USD after 5 posts. Bonus: 5% of one month article earnings for posts with more than 1000 views. Payments would be made using Paypal or local bank transfer in local currency, if supported.

As said above, for writers who exclusively chose to be our writers, would get additional benefits in terms of bonus payments and hardware requirements, if any. Basically, we would be happy to help you as a work family.
